# Devil May Cry 3 (HD Collection)

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and
export a config file.

## What does randomization do in DMC3?
Key Items, Weapons, Styles and Skills and other upgrades are all randomized. You may end up having to replay missions once you get new weapons in order to destroy previous style checks for the chance at new items.

## What is the goal?
To beat the game aka Mission 20

## What is a check?
A check is any item that can be picked up in the game. I.e Randomly found Vital Star's, new weapons or styles, or even blue orb fragments.
